Generate a JSON object for a bilingual lesson in the following format:

{
  "title": <string>,
  "langA-B": ["en", "pt"],
  "exercises": [
    {
      "A": <sentence in language A>,
      "B": <translation in language B>,
      "noiseA": <space-separated distractor words for language A>,
      "noiseB": <space-separated distractor words for language B>
    },
    // ...more exercises
  ]
}

Instructions:
- Generate 20 exercises total.
- Language A is English and language B is Portuguese.
- Use difficult content: uncommon verb tenses, idiomatic expressions, subtle grammar traps
- For each exercise, provide:
  - "A": the sentence in language A
  - "B": the translation in language B
  - "noiseA": space-separated distractor words for language A (optional, 1-5 words, do not repeat words from the sentence)
  - "noiseB": space-separated distractor words for language B (optional, 1-5 words, do not repeat words from the translation)
- Distractors should fit phonetically or semantically, but not contain any words from the actual sentence/translation
- Output valid JSON in the format above.
