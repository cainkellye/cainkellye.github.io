Generate a JSON object with 20 hard-level bilingual language lesson entries for Portuguese learners.

Each lesson should be structured as:
{
  "prompt": <string>,
  "solution": <string>,
  "distractors": <string>,
  "lang": "<prompt lang code>;<solution lang code>"
}

Instructions:
- 10 prompts should be in English with Portuguese solutions ("lang": "en;pt")
- 10 prompts should be in Portuguese with English solutions ("lang": "pt;en")
- The "distractors" field should be a single space-separated string of words (no array)
- Distractors should seemingly fit the solution (phonetically or semantically), but not contain any words from the actual solution
- Based on the length of the solution, use 1-4 disctractors.
- The content should be difficult: use uncommon verb tenses, idiomatic expressions, or subtle grammar traps
- Output valid JSON under the key "lessons"
