Generate a JSON object with 20 hard-level bilingual language lesson entries for Portuguese learners.

Each lesson should be structured as:
{
  "prompt": <string>,
  "solution": <string>,
  "distractors": <string>
}

Instructions:
- 10 prompts should be in English with Portuguese solutions (EN → PT)
- 10 prompts should be in Portuguese with English solutions (PT → EN)
- The "distractors" field should be a single space-separated string of 1–4 words (no array)
- Distractors must resemble words in the solution (phonetically or semantically), but not contain any words from the actual solution
- If the solution has 9 words or more, include at most 1 distractor
- The content should be very difficult: use uncommon verb tenses, idiomatic expressions, or subtle grammar traps
- Output valid JSON under the key "lessons"
